#### remove recent posts section  

To remove the "Recent Posts" section, the files most likely to need changes are:

1. `config/_default/params.yaml` - This file might contain configuration settings for enabling or disabling sections like "Recent Posts".
2. `layouts/_default/baseof.html` or similar layout files - These files might define the structure of the pages and include the "Recent Posts" section.

Please add these files to the chat so I can help you make the necessary changes.

#### Add content/_index.md  
> Add content/_index.md to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

To remove the "Recent Posts" section from `content/_index.md`, we need to delete the corresponding block. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to achieve this:

content/_index.md
```yaml
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  - block: collection
    id: posts
    content:
      title: Recent Posts
      subtitle: ''
      text: ''
      # Choose how many pages you would like to display (0 = all pages)
      count: 5
      # Filter on criteria
      filters:
        folders:
          - post
        author: ""
        category: ""
        tag: ""
        exclude_featured: false
        exclude_future: false
        exclude_past: false
        publication_type: ""
      # Choose how many pages you would like to offset by
      offset: 0
      # Page order: descending (desc) or ascending (asc) date.
      order: desc
    design:
      # Choose a layout view
      view: compact
      columns: '2'

```

#### comment recent posts section  

To comment out the "Recent Posts" section in `content/_index.md`, we will wrap the section in comment syntax. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to achieve this:

content/_index.md
```yaml
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  - block: collection
    id: posts
    content:
      title: Recent Posts
      subtitle: ''
      text: ''
      # Choose how many pages you would like to display (0 = all pages)
      count: 5
      # Filter on criteria
      filters:
        folders:
          - post
        author: ""
        category: ""
        tag: ""
        exclude_featured: false
        exclude_future: false
        exclude_past: false
        publication_type: ""
      # Choose how many pages you would like to offset by
      offset: 0
      # Page order: descending (desc) or ascending (asc) date.
      order: desc
    design:
      # Choose a layout view
      view: compact
      columns: '2'
=======
  # - block: collection
  #   id: posts
  #   content:
  #     title: Recent Posts
  #     subtitle: ''
  #     text: ''
  #     # Choose how many pages you would like to display (0 = all pages)
  #     count: 5
  #     # Filter on criteria
  #     filters:
  #       folders:
  #         - post
  #       author: ""
  #       category: ""
  #       tag: ""
  #       exclude_featured: false
  #       exclude_future: false
  #       exclude_past: false
  #       publication_type: ""
  #     # Choose how many pages you would like to offset by
  #     offset: 0
  #     # Page order: descending (desc) or ascending (asc) date.
  #     order: desc
  #   design:
  #     # Choose a layout view
  #     view: compact
  #     columns: '2'
